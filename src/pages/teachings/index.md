My teaching is focused on four key principles; connection, courage, creativity, contribution which are encompassed within The Light Tree philosophy.

The tree is the realisation of the seed. Plant the seed, feed and water it, give it sunlight and the tree will grow strong and healthy, always towards the light. Our thoughts, intentions and actions are the seeds of our life.

Just like a tree, from each root to every leaf, everything is connected. We are connected to everything through energy, we are a unique manifestation of that energy in matter form. The outer world we experience is simply a reflection of our inner experience.

Through Yoga practice we embark on an inner journey of transformation - a cyclical process of self-enquiry, discovery and evolution that begins, at least initially, on our mats.  

* Connection: 
* We discover how to connect with ourselves on a deeper level physically, mentally, emotionally and soulfully becoming more aware of and **connected** with our true inner self and our potential.  
* Courage: 
* By finding vulnerability we open ourselves up to a world of experimentation and curiosity through which we can begin to build trust and the **courage** in ourselves, the practice and in life 
* Creativity: 
* As a result we understand that how through connected awareness and mindful choice we **create** better, happier and more fulfilled lives 
* Contribution: 
* And with this we learn how to approach our lives as a **contribution** to bring into action a life that better serves us, those around us and the world as a whole. 

With regular practice these four principles transcend the mat, in each cycle we unveil, discover, grow and evolve, shining more of our light out into the world.
