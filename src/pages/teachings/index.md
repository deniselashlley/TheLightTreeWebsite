Your practice is your personal journey. I am here to guide you safely and mindfully through your explorations, providing options that allow you to create a practice that best serves you in that moment.

I encourage a deeper more soulful connection to your body and mind through intention, movement, breath, focus, sound and in group settings togetherness, to shift energy and raise your vibration.

My teaching is focused on four key principles; curiosity, connection, creativity, contribution which are encompassed within The Light Tree philosophy.

Through embodiment practices we embark on an inner journey of transformation - a cyclical process of self-enquiry, discovery and evolution that begins, at least initially, on our mats.  

* CURIOSITY:   Through our practice we can find a humility and vulnerability that allows us to approach experiences with more openness, experimentation and **curiosity** helping us to build trust in ourselves and our capabilities and the courage pursue all the possibilities that brings.
* CONNECTION:  We discover how to connect with ourselves on a deeper level physically, mentally, emotionally and soulfully becoming more aware of and **connected** with the experience we are having, our true inner self and our potential
* CREATIVITY: As a result we can begin to see and understand that we affect and influence our own experience. Through connected awareness, courageous vulnerability and mindful choice we have the power to **create** healthier bodies and minds and happier, more positive and fulfilled lives. 
* CONTRIBUTION:   These experiences teach us how to approach our lives with more gratitude and recognise that we have a **contribution** to share with the world - a life that better serves us, those around us and the world as a whole. 

With regular practice these four principles and what we learn about ourselves transcend the mat. In each of the many cycles of life we find our self in we unveil, discover, grow and evolve, shining more of our light out into the world.
