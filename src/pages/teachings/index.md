I see the tree as an amazing analogy for our lives and our experience. Just like a tree, from each root to every leaf, everything is connected. We are connected to everything through energy and we are a unique manifestation of that energy in matter form. 

The tree is the realisation of the seed. Plant the seed, feed and water it, give it sunlight and from it the tree will grow strong and healthy, always towards the light. Our thoughts, intentions and actions are the seeds of our life and the outer world we experience is simply a reflection and manifestation of what we are experiencing within us.

My teaching is focused on four key principles; connection, courage, creativity, contribution which are encompassed within The Light Tree philosophy.

Through Yoga practice we embark on an inner journey of transformation - a cyclical process of self-enquiry, discovery and evolution that begins, at least initially, on our mats.  

* CONNECTION: 
* We discover how to connect with ourselves on a deeper level physically, mentally, emotionally and soulfully becoming more aware of and **connected** with the experience we are having and our true inner self and our potential.  



* COURAGE: 
* Through our practice we can find a humility and vulnerability that allows us to approach experiences with more openness, experimentation and curiosity which helps us to build trust and the **courage** in ourselves, our capabilities and the possibilities that brings.



* CREATIVITY: As a result we can begin to see and understand that we affect and influence our own experience and through connected awareness, courageous vulnerability and mindful choice we have the power to **create** better, happier and more fulfilled lives 



* CONTRIBUTION: 
* Through these experiences we learn how to approach our lives with more gratitude and recognise that we have a **contribution** to share with the world - a life that better serves us, those around us and the world as a whole. 

With regular practice these four principles and what we learn about ourselves transcend the mat. In each of the many cycles of life we find our self in we unveil, discover, grow and evolve, shining more of our light out into the world.
