<p>Your practice is your personal journey. I am here to be alongside you to safely support your explorations, providing options that allow you to create a practice that best serves you in each moment.</p>
<p>I encourage a deeper more soulful connection to your body and mind through intention, movement, breath, focus, sound and in group settings togetherness, to shift energy and raise your vibration.</p>
<p>My approach is focused on four core principles; curiosity, connection, creativity, contribution.</p>
<p><img src="../img/the-4cs-21.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Through embodiment practices we embark on an inner journey of transformation - a cyclical process of self-enquiry, discovery and evolution that begins where you are.</p>
<ul>
<li>CURIOSITY: Through our practice we can find a humility and vulnerability that allows us to approach experiences with more openness, experimentation and <strong>curiosity</strong> helping us to build trust in ourselves and our capabilities and the courage pursue all the possibilities that brings.</li>
<li>CONNECTION: Through gently inviting safer moments with oursleves we re:member how to connect with our Being on a deeper level physically, mentally, emotionally and soulfully becoming more aware of and <strong>connected</strong> with the experience we are having, our true inner self and our potential</li>
<li>CREATIVITY: As we begin to become aware, we may notice how we respond to and influence our own experience. Through embodied awareness, courageous vulnerability and mindful choice we have the power to <strong>create</strong> healthier, happier, more fulfilled lives.</li>
<li>CONTRIBUTION: These experiences give us choice in how we relate with ourselves while also recognising the <strong>contribution</strong> we share with the world - a life that better serves us, those around us and the world as a whole.</li>
</ul>
<p>With regular practice these four principles and what we learn about ourselves transcend the pratice space. In each of the many cycles of life we find our self in we unveil, discover, grow and evolve, shining more of our light out into the world.</p>
