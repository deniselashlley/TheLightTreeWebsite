A Yogini, Focalizing Somatic Practitioner and Embodied Mystic I began my personal healing and empowerment journey with Yoga back in 2002. 

This journey led me to begin teaching Yoga in 2015, originally training in Ashtanga and then Yin, Restorative and Non-Dual Tantra Yoga, as well as Somatic and Embodiment Practices. I am also an Indigenous African Spirituality and Celtic Earth-Based Practitioner. 

As a mixed-Black bodied woman, I centre the healing of race-based and patriarchal trauma, exploring and unravelling how these impressions manifest in our bodies and minds to inhibit our true nature, power and magic.

My offerings include private 1:1 and group sessions which are guided by intuitive, holistic self or collective inquiry and expression, through practices informed by my own journey. 

Focalizing is a body based, holistic way of helping people work through emotions, trauma and experiences that doesnâ€™t require analysing the story of what happened. As the Practitioner I hold a space free of judgement or fixing that empowers You, the Focalizer, to access your intuitive, embodied wisdom to heal from trauma, let go of emotional baggage and conditioned thinking, restoring your natural equilibrium.

I am devoted to facilitating person-centred, trauma-sensitive and nature-aligned healing spaces, for embodied explorations that cultivate self-love and community care for our collective wellbeing and empowerment.
