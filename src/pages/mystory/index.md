<p style="text-align: left;">Now an Embodiment Practioner and Advocate, I began my personal healing and empowerment journey with Yoga back in 2002.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This journey led me to begin teaching Yoga in 2015, originally training in Ashtanga and along the way expanding to Yin, Restorative and Non-Dual Tantra Yoga, as well as Somatic and Embodiment Practices. I am a certified Sound Healer, an Indigenous African Spirituality and Celtic Earth-Based Practitioner.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As a mixed-Black bodied woman, I know the lived experience, the beauty and the stressors, that can accompany navigating life in the UK. I centre the healing of race-based and patriarchal trauma, exploring and unravelling how these impressions manifest in our bodies and minds to inhibit our true nature, divine power and magic.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My offerings include private 1-2-1 and group sessions which are guided by intuitive, holistic self inquiry and expression,&nbsp; and grounded in the practices of Yoga, Somatics, Sound Healing, Indigenous Embodiement Lineages.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I am devoted to facilitating person-centred, trauma-sensitive, nature-aligned healing spaces. These are embodied explorations that cultivate and celebrate self-love and community care for our collective wellbeing and empowerment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(176, 70, 100);">I help curious seekers courageously re-member the wisdom within your bodies and hearts, to explore a more connected, creative and authentic life</span></strong></p>
