<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Hello, I'm Jae. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Pisces sun + rising, lunar aquarius. I am a curious dreamer, intrigued by the mystic and the places beyond our knowing. I increasingly find myself standing, in complete awe, at the intersection of spirituality and science, where our human desire to explain our existence meets our absolute divine knowing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif;">This shows up in my optimistic leaning, reality expanding, slightly introverted, distantly present, raw love personality and a nervous system that tends towards withdraw and freeze for safety.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">I am of free thinking hippy-ish parents, a musician and an educator, from a mixed Caribbean and English family. As a mixed-heritgae Black woman, I have the lived experience; the absolute beauty and joy and the complex considerations and stresses, that are a part of navigating this life in this body.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">My experiences have led me to centre the healing of race-based and patriarchal trauma, to explore and unravel how these impressions manifest in our body-mind to inhibit the expression of our true nature, divine power and magic. This has become a process of re:membering the divine through the celebration of African diasporic culture, traditions and practices.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">I embrace my humanness by connecting with curiousity, nature, creativity, divinity and playfulyness. It often calls for courage and commitment, which I've found to be nurtured through community. These are the things that continue to bring me home to myself and closer to my true nature.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">I began my healing and empowerment journey with Yoga back in 2002. In 2015 I trained in Ashtanga Yoga and along the way I expanded to Yin, Restorative and Non-Dual Tantra Yoga. I am a certified Somatic Focalizing Practicioner, a Sound Healer and I practice Indigenous African Spirituality and Celtic Earth-Based traditions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">I honour my teachers and bow the lineages that have guided me; Acharya Arvind and Acharya Rakesh of Samyak Yoga, Uma Dinsmore Tuli, Dalian and Verona of Ancestral Voices, Leila Sadaghee, Nick and Jo from The Focalizing Institute and the Sound Healing Academy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">My journey, and the practices I've collected along the way, inform my offerings, guided by intuitive self-inquiry, creative expression and interconnectedness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The spaces I hold are person-centred, trauma-sensitive, nature-aligned and cosmically-attuned. These are 1-2-1 and group embodied explorations that cultivate and celebrate self-love and community care for our collective wellbeing and empowerment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(176, 70, 100);">I support courageous seekers, just like you, re:member the wisdom within your heart, to explore more connection, creativity, joy and freedom</span></strong></span></p>
