<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif;">As a mixed-Black bodied woman, I know the lived experience; the beauty and joy, as well as the stressors and considerations that can become a part of navigating this life. I centre the healing of race-based and patriarchal trauma, exploring and unravelling how these impressions manifest in our bodies and minds to inhibit the expression of our true nature, divine power and magic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif;">I began my own personal healing and empowerment journey with Yoga back in 2002.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif;">This journey led me to begin teaching Yoga in 2015, originally training in Ashtanga and along the way expanding to Yin, Restorative and Non-Dual Tantra Yoga. I am a certified Somatic Focalizing Practicioner and Sound Healer with a special interest in Indigenous African Spirituality and Celtic Earth-Based Practices.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif;">My journey and these modalities inform my offerings which include 1-2-1 and group sessions, which are guided by intuitive, holistic self-inquiry, creative expression and interconnectedness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif;">I am devoted to facilitating person-centred, trauma-sensitive, nature-aligned healing spaces. These are embodied explorations that cultivate and celebrate self-love and community care for our collective wellbeing and empowerment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(176, 70, 100);">I help curious seekers, just like you, courageously re-member the wisdom within your heart, to explore a more connected, creative and authentic life</span></strong></span></p>
