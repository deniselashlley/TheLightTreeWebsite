A Yogini, Focalizing Somatic Practitioner and Embodied Mystic I began my own healing and empowerment journey with Yoga in 2002. In 2015 I began leading Yoga classes, sharing the ancient spiritual principles and practices along with my personal learnings. 

As a part of reclaiming my ancestral lineage and moving toward a decolonised identity, I have embarked on a priestess journey into the arts of indigenous Afro and Celtic spiritual practice.

I am a certified Focalizing Practitioner, a trauma informed, self-empowered therapy focused on accessing embodied wisdom to heal emotional wounds and guide a more authentic lived experience.

I facilitate person-centred, trauma-sensitive and nature-aligned healing spaces for embodied explorations that cultivate self-love and community care for our collective wellbeing and empowerment. 

As a mixed-Black bodied woman, I centre the healing of race-based and patriarchal trauma, exploring and unravelling how these impressions manifest in our bodies and minds to inhibit our true nature, power and magic.
