<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Hello, I'm Jae. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Pisces sun + rising, lunar aquarius. I am a curious dreamer, intrigued by the mystic and the places beyond our knowing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif;">This shows up in my optimistic leaning, reality expanding, slightly introverted, distantly present, raw love personality&nbsp; and a nervous system that tends towards freeze for saftey when uncomfortable moments come into view.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">I am of free thinking hippy-ish parents from a mixed Caribbean and English family. As a mixed-Black bodied woman, I know the lived experience; the beauty and joy, as well as the stressors and considerations that can become a part of navigating this life. I centre the healing of race-based and patriarchal trauma, exploring and unravelling how these impressions manifest in our bodies and minds to inhibit the expression of our true nature, divine power and magic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">I honour my humanness by connecting with curiousity, creativity and playfulyness, which often calls for courage and has been nurtured through community. All of which continues to bring me home to myself and my true nature.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">I began my own personal healing and empowerment journey with Yoga back in 2002. In 2015 I trained in Ashtanga Yoga and along the way I expanded to Yin, Restorative and Non-Dual Tantra Yoga. I am a certified Somatic Focalizing Practicioner and Sound Healer with a special interest in Indigenous African Spirituality and Celtic Earth-Based Practices.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">My journey and these modalities inform my offerings including 1-2-1 and group sessions, guided by intuitive, holistic self-inquiry, creative expression and interconnectedness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">I am devoted to facilitating person-centred, trauma-sensitive, nature-aligned healing spaces. These are embodied explorations that cultivate and celebrate self-love and community care for our collective wellbeing and empowerment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(176, 70, 100);">I help curious seekers, just like you, courageously re-member the wisdom within your heart, to explore a more connected, creative and authentic life</span></strong></span></p>
