  A Yogi and Embodied Mystic, Jae began her journey with Yoga in 2002. In 2015
  she began leading classes, sharing the ancient wisdom, practices and her
  personal learnings. In 2018, as a part of reclaiming her lineage and identity,
  she began a priestess journey into the Afro and Celtic mystic arts.


  Jae facilities healing spaces for embodied explorations that cultivate
  self-love and community care for our collective wellbeing and empowerment. As
  a mixed-black bodied woman, she centres the healing of ethnic race-based and
  patriarchal trauma, exploring and unravelling how these impressions manifest
  in our bodies and minds to inhibit our true nature, power and magic as women.

  YOUR SELF AND YOUR TRUE POTENTIAL?"
