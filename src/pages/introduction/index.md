  Welcome to The Light Tree 


  The invitation is to embark on a journey of re-membering our
  inter-connectedness to reawaken and explore our Aliveness.


  The tree is the realisation of the seed being loved into existence. The seed
  is a gift passed on, an intelligent imprint of nature, uniquely expressed, a
  miraculous becoming. Intrinsically connected with the elements the seed grows,
  nourished safely within the earth, hydrated by the rain, energised by the sun
  and breathed by the air. As the seed sprouts roots, the sapling grows ever
  towards the light, to become the tree it was designed to become. The tree is
  simply living it's tree life.


  Our lives are trees, formed from the roots of before and ever expanding
  towards the beyond, intrinsically connected to one another, loved into
  existence. As humans our beliefs, stories and intentions are the seeds of our
  life, our perception and experience of the outer world a reflection and
  manifestation of what we are nurturing within us. 


  In a world where we are incentivised to live head centred, with a limiting and
  harmful concept of our humanness, our stories can takes over, disconnecting
  us  from our authentic being. Embodiment and heart-centred practices invite us
  to re-member that we are more, to receive valuable information our bodies
  hold, intrinsically connected to each other
