  This is an invitation to embark on a journey of re-membering our
  inter-connectedness to reawaken and explore our Aliveness.


  The tree is the realisation of the seed being loved into existence. The seed
  is a gift paid forward, an intelligent imprint of nature, uniquely expressed,
  a miraculous becoming. Intrinsically connected with the elements the seed
  grows, nourished safely within the earth, hydrated by the rain, energised by
  the sun and breathed by the air. As the seed sprouts expanding roots, the
  sapling grows ever towards the light, to become the tree it was designed to
  become. 


  Us humans are no different to trees, formed from seeds, connected by the roots
  of before and ever expanding towards the beyond. We are loved into existence.
  Intrinsically connected to one another. 


  Living in environments where our bodies are marginalised, our minds overloaded
  and our hearts neglected, the emotional wounds we receive are normalised and
  not acknowledged so often go unchecked and unhealed. As humans our beliefs,
  stories and intentions are the seeds of our life, our perception and
  experience of the outer world a reflection and manifestation of what we are
  nurturing or neglecting within us. 


  We are being called back to the old ways to be re-membered and connected in
  these modern global times. Embodiment and heart-centred practices invite us to
  re-member that we are that we are more, to embrace our whole being, to receive
  valuable healing and empowering information our bodies hold.


  Let's create space for not knowing or needing to know. To dance to the music
  of our curiosity. Explore the order and disordering of aliveness. Notice the
  blips and textures and movements. 


  A place to expand into the otherness of our humanness. Unwind into the freedom
  of discomfort or the discomfort of freedom. Backstroke in the joy of beautiful
  imperfections 


  A space to explore the whole being we are. 


  A space for being as it is.
