  Hi, my name is Jess and welcome to The Light Tree. 


  Whether you want to strengthen your body or create more flexibility. Maybe you
  are simply looking for some time for yourself, or you  want to learn how to
  feel more balanced. Maybe you are on a journey of self-realisation. Yoga is a
  system of transformation that can be accessed by everyone whatever your age,
  shape, size, ethnicity, socio-economic background. 


  I run group classes, workshops and private sessions for all abilities and I am
  passionate about helping you to energise your body, calm your mind, nourish
  your soul and shine your light.

  ENDURE, TO TRANSFORM, TO LOVE AND TO BE GREATER THAN OUR SUFFERING." - Ben
