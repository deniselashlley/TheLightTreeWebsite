<h3>we are being called back to the old ways to help us navigate our modern lives, collectively, in more harmony, and with less harm to ourselves, each other and our home.</h3>

<p>Let's create space for not knowing or needing to know.</p> 

<p>To dance to the music of our curiosity.</p> 

<p>Explore the order and disordering of aliveness.</p> 

<p>Notice the blips and textures and movements.</p> 

<p>A place to expand into the otherness of our humanness.</p> 

<p>Unwind into the freedom of discomfort or the discomfort of freedom.</p> 

<p>Backstroke in the joy of beautiful imperfections</p> 

<p>A space to explore the whole being we are</p> 

<p>A space for being as it is.</p>

<p style="align-center">I invite you to join me for embodied explorations, journeys and events to
  reawaken and restore our sense of Aliveness!</p>
