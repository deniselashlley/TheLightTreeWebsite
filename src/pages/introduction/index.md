### we are being called back to the old ways to help us navigate our modern lives, collectively, in more harmony, and with less harm to ourselves, each other and our home.

*Let's create space for not knowing or needing to know.* 

*To dance to the music of our curiosity.* 

*Explore the order and disordering of aliveness.* 

*Notice the blips and textures and movements.* 

*A place to expand into the otherness of our humanness.* 

*Unwind into the freedom of discomfort or the discomfort of freedom.* 

*Backstroke in the joy of beautiful imperfections* 

*A space to explore the whole being we are* 

*A space for being as it is.*
