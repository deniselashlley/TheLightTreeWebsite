<p>Yoga translates as Yoke or Union in ancient Sanskrit meaning to connect. This refers to both the state of connection and the techniques and practices used to connect. The practice of Yoga dates back thousands of years and is known to originate from ancient India but has also been found in ancient Africa and the far-east. The system of Yoga is founded in ancient wisdom that forms a guide of practices to help you access a deeper level of awareness and connection leading to a healthier and happier, more balanced and fulfilled life.</p>
<p>The most commonly known form of Yoga is Asana, the postures, however Yoga also involves breathing and mediation practices and observations for daily life. The practice of Yoga is not a one-size-fits-all approach so you begin with your own personal intention exploring and adopting the practices that work for you at any one time and in this way it becomes your individual practice.</p>
<p>A regular Yoga practice improves your physical, mental and emotional health and wellbeing</p>
