      Health is “a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and
      not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (illness)" and wellness is
      “the optimal state of health of individuals and groups", as defined by
      WHO.


      I offer a reduced rate or FOC regular class to one change-making group or charitable organisation for their service users and staff.
