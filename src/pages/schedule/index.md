      The next SOULFUL SISTAHOOD is coming up later this month. On Sunday 28th
      we come together again in a circle of sisters to connect with and
      celebrate our womanhood in all it’s power.


      This workshop is all about connecting with our inner Goddess and exploring
      her warrior heart to discover how we can identify and then lovingly slay
      those beliefs and behaviours that are holding us back from living in our
      full power.


      Expect some Yoga practices, discussion, personal reflection, intention
      setting and journaling. You will leave with some tools that will help you
      bring more awareness and balance into your life. All levels welcome, no
      previous Yoga experience necessary.


      If you came to the last event you will know that these circles are
      powerful, I really hope you can make it. Spread the word.

      The Revival Retreat in takes place in the beautiful setting of the
      Austrian mountains. 


      I'll be a part of the team creating this nurturing and nourishing
      experience for women. This retreat has been created to support you in
      cultivating the emotional and mental space within yourself that allows you
      to develop into your most authentic and powerful self.


      I'm excited to be bringing you 3 powerful sessions that will connect you
      in a more soulful way with yourself;


      • **The Yoga Circle:** Women have met in circles for millennia. Something
      powerful happens when women come together in love and support of each
      other. Meeting in a circle creates a safe space where we can come together
      in ritual and practice to celebrate of our Self and our womanhood in all
      it’s power.


      • **Cleansing the Soul:** Learn how to integrate simple practices and
      rituals into your life to support the removal of physical, mental and
      emotional energetic blockages that will allow you to connect with your
      Self on a deeper, more loving and soulful level.


      • **Full Moon Release:** We will come together for a final time to share
      the meaning of womanhood making pledges to our Self as we release it all
      to the universe.


      The retreat also includes EFT, PSYCH - K Balancing and life coaching
      sessions for a truly transformative experience.
