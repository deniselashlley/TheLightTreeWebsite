      <h2><span style="color: rgb(176, 70, 100);">&nbsp;Embodying
      Aliveness</span>&nbsp;</h2>

      <p><strong> </strong><span style="color: rgb(23, 58, 46);"><strong>A Collective Self-Care &amp; Empowerment Journey </strong></span></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><span style="color: rgb(23, 58, 46);">Embodying Aliveness is a rite of passage created for black women and women of colour, who seek space and time to unveil more ease and joy. </span></p>

      <p><span style="color: rgb(23, 58, 46);">Join this self-care and empowerment journey to explore embodied heart-centred practice through self-inquiry, movement, breathwork, creative expression and deep rest.</span></p>

      <p><span style="color: rgb(23, 58, 46);">Here you belong, you are seen, heard, valued and celebrated. Together we&rsquo;ll create a safe and caring community that bears witness to our collective and individual journeys. Each of us giving the other permission to show up, authentically and unapologetically. </span></p>

      <p><span style="color: rgb(23, 58, 46);">Women have gathered like this for millenia. This is a radical act in today&rsquo;s world where our minds are overloaded, our bodies marginalised and our emotional wounds neglected. </span></p>

      <p><span style="color: rgb(23, 58, 46);">This is an invitation to re-member the old ways, to navigate new days, embracing the full spectrum of what it feels to be alive.</span></p>
