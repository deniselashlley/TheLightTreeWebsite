      Join me in this exploration of BE:coming. We gather at the Supermoon before Summer Solstice, a time when nature comes into full bloom, a flourish of BE:coming. You will be held in a supportive community as I guide you on a journey inwards through personal and collective inquiry, movement, breathwork and soundscape.

      ### Embodying Aliveness


      #### A Collective Self-Care & Empowerment Journey




      **Embodying Aliveness is a rite of passage created for black women and women of colour, who seek space and time to unveil more ease and joy. Join this self-care and empowerment journey to explore embodied heart-centred practice through self-inquiry, movement, breathwork, creative expression and deep rest.** 


      Here you belong, you are seen, heard, valued and celebrated. Together we’ll create a safe and caring community that bears witness to our collective and individual journeys. Each of us giving the other permission to show up, authentically and unapologetically.


      Women have gathered like this for millenia. This is a radical act in today’s world where our minds are overloaded, our bodies marginalised and our emotional wounds neglected. 


      **This is an invitation to re-member the old ways, to navigate new days, embracing the full spectrum of what it feels to be alive.**
