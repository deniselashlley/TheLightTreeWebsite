    title: THIS SUMMER
  - body: "<p>### Embodying Aliveness #### A Collective Self-Care &amp; Empowerment
      Journey **Embodying Aliveness is a rite of passage created for black women
      and women of colour, who seek space and time to unveil more ease and joy.
      Join this self-care and empowerment journey to explore embodied
      heart-centred practice through self-inquiry, movement, breathwork,
      creative expression and deep rest.**&nbsp; Here you belong, you are seen,
      heard, valued and celebrated. Together we&rsquo;ll create a safe and
      caring community that bears witness to our collective and individual
      journeys. Each of us giving the other permission to show up, authentically
      and unapologetically. Women have gathered like this for millenia. This is
      a radical act in today&rsquo;s world where our minds are overloaded, our
      bodies marginalised and our emotional wounds neglected. **This is an
      invitation to re-member the old ways, to navigate new days, embracing the
      full spectrum of what it feels to be alive.** - - -</p>"
