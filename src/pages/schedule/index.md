  - body: "## Embodied Aliveness\n\n\n\nAN INTRODUCTION TO AN EMPOWERED LIFE\n\n\n\nAn invitation to discover a more embodied and empowered way of being, for our holistic connection and authentic expression of ourselves as women. Living in environments where our bodies are marginalised, our minds overloaded and our hearts neglected, the emotional wounds we receive are normalised and not acknowledged so often go unchecked and unhealed.\r\n\n\r\n\nCreated for self-identifying black women and women of colour, this is a 6 week embodied healing and empowerment journey of self-inquiry and community care through conversation, movement, breathwork, meditation and intentional rest.\n\n\n\n**\\~ ( ( ( O ) ) ) \\~**\n\n- - -"
