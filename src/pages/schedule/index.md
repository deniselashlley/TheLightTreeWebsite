      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><span style="color: rgb(23, 58, 46); font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif;">Embodying Aliveness is a rite of passage created for Black Women and Women of Colour, who seek an intentional space and time to experience more ease and joy in your life.&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p><span style="color: rgb(23, 58, 46); font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif;">Join this collective self-care and empowerment journey to explore embodied heart-centred practice through self-inquiry, movement, breath awareness, creative expression and deep rest.</span></p>

      <p><span style="color: rgb(23, 58, 46); font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif;">Women have gathered like this for millenia. This is a radical act in today&rsquo;s world where our minds are overloaded, our bodies marginalised and our emotional wounds neglected. </span></p>
