      The Revival Retreat in takes place in the beautiful setting of the
      Austrian mountains. 


      I'll be a part of the team creating this nurturing and nourishing
      experience for women. This retreat has been created to support you in
      cultivating the emotional and mental space within yourself that allows you
      to develop into your most authentic and powerful self.


      I'm excited to be bringing you 3 powerful sessions that will connect you
      in a more soulful way with yourself;


      • **The Yoga Circle:** Women have met in circles for millennia. Something
      powerful happens when women come together in love and support of each
      other. Meeting in a circle creates a safe space where we can come together
      in ritual and practice to celebrate of our Self and our womanhood in all
      it’s power.


      • **Cleansing the Soul:** Learn how to integrate simple practices and
      rituals into your life to support the removal of physical, mental and
      emotional energetic blockages that will allow you to connect with your
      Self on a deeper, more loving and soulful level.


      • **Full Moon Release:** We will come together for a final time to share
      the meaning of womanhood making pledges to our Self as we release it all
      to the universe.


      The retreat also includes EFT, PSYCH - K Balancing and life coaching
      sessions for a truly transformative experience.
