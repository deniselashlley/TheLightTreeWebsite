  - body: "# **Soulful Sistahood**\n\n**Date**: Sunday 26th January 2020 \n**Venue**: Common Healing, 32 Nunhead Green\r, Nunhead, SE15 3QF\r.\n\n[More info & tickets here](https://www.tickettailor.com/events/commonhealing/334926#)\n\n**The healing path of Forgiveness, Gratitude and Intention\r**\n\nIn this workshop we will incorporate forgiveness and gratitude practices to bring ourselves into harmony and alignment with the universe as we embrace the beginning of this new cycle over the first New Moon of the decade. Join me for this sister circle to share the power of the Divine Feminine through practices and tools that will support you to clear negative energy and raise your vibration creating space for clarity and intention setting. \r\n\nYou will be encouraged to connect on a deeper more soulful level with your body and mind through intention, movement, breath, focus and sound. As we move and breathe through a sequence of Yoga postures and practices we will pause to reflect, visualise, journal and if we chose to, share what we are experiencing. Rounding off with Yoga Nidra to bring clarity to our intentions. This is an open level workshop, no previous yoga experience necessary. Come as you are, bring an open and curious mind and don't forget a notebook and pen :-) \n\nIf you've been to a previous event you will know that these circles are powerful, I really hope you can make it. Spread the word."
