sectionMyStory:
  body: " I have been a practitioner of Yoga since 2002 and began teaching Yoga in since 2015. \r\n\nI discovered Yoga in a time of transition while I was ending a 9 year relationship and I was looking for some respite, solace and ‘me’ time. \r\n\nAt the end of my first class I felt amazing, so I went back for another and another.  I discovered that through simply spending a regular 90 minutes with myself focused on breathing, moving and becoming still I began to become closer to myself, feel better about myself and in my body. I also started to become aware of some of my limiting beliefs that were preventing me from moving forward that showed up in my practice. My practice mat was like a mirror! I was awoken to the fact that I had not been looking after myself and this had led me to become disconnected, have a lack of clarity of who I was, what I wanted or how to move forward.\r\n\nI had a realisation that putting myself first was necessary to my physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health. Self-care was not selfish but was in fact unselfish. By looking after my own needs I was able to be healthier and happier, have a more positive and productive approach to my life and contribute more to the lives of those in my life, particularly my son who was only 6 at the time.\r\n\nMy life began to move forward. Putting my Yoga into action took some focus, practice and some breaks to remind how much better I felt when I returned, it took some time. Over the years I explored different styles Bikram Hot Yoga, Vinyasa Flow, Ashtanga, Iyengar, Scaravelli, my understanding deepened and my practice developed. \r\n\nIn 2015 I took the opportunity for voluntary redundancy from my pretty intense corporate marketing job. Although I had achieved my goal of a successful marketing career it had become my entire focus and measurement of success, it had taken over and again I had become disconnected. I took the blessing and lesson offered and grabbed the opportunity for a new start and to begin to create a life that better served mySelf. \r\n\nI was blessed to be able to spend time in an ashram with Samyak Yoga School in Mysore, India training to become a teacher in the Ashtanga Yoga lineage. This was the first step on my journey as a teacher and I have continued to train to expand my teaching in Vinyasa Flow, Yin, Restorative and Pregnancy Yoga and will continue to learn, develop my own practice which I share through my teaching.\r\n\nI now realise that, on many occasions in my past, life had been attempting to ‘wake me up’ to mySelf, to connect me, in a more intuitive way, to the innate ability \\[that we all share] to create my life in my vision."
