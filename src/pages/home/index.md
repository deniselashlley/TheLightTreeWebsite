sectionMyStory:
  body: >2-
     I have been a practitioner of Yoga since 2002 and began teaching Yoga in since 2015. 

    I discovered Yoga in a time of transition while I was ending a 9 year
    relationship and I was looking for some respite, solace and ‘me’ time. 


    At the end of my first class I felt amazing, so I went back for another and
    another.  I discovered that through simply spending a regular 90 minutes
    with myself focused on breathing, moving and becoming still I began to
    become closer to myself, feel better about myself and in my body. I also
    started to become aware of some of my limiting beliefs that were preventing
    me from moving forward that showed up in my practice. My practice mat was
    like a mirror! I was awoken to the fact that I had not been looking after
    myself and this had led me to become disconnected, have a lack of clarity of
    who I was, what I wanted or how to move forward.


    I had a realisation that putting myself first was necessary to my physical,
    mental, emotional and spiritual health. Self-care was not selfish but was in
    fact unselfish. By looking after my own needs I was able to be healthier and
    happier, have a more positive and productive approach to my life and
    contribute more to the lives of those in my life, particularly my son who
    was only 6 at the time.

    My life began to move forward. Putting my Yoga into action took some focus,
    practice and some breaks to remind how much better I felt when I returned,
    it took some time. Over the years I explored different styles Bikram Hot
    Yoga, Vinyasa Flow, Ashtanga, Iyengar, Scaravelli, my understanding deepened
    and my practice developed. 


    In 2015 I took the opportunity for voluntary redundancy from my pretty
    intense corporate marketing job. Although I had achieved my goal of a
    successful marketing career it had become my entire focus and measurement of
    success, it had taken over and again I had become disconnected. I took the
    blessing and lesson offered and grabbed the opportunity for a new start and
    to begin to create a life that better served mySelf. 


    I was blessed to be able to spend time in an ashram with Samyak Yoga School
    in Mysore, India training to become a teacher in the Ashtanga Yoga lineage. 


    **This was the first step on my journey as a teacher and I have continued to
    train to expand my teaching in Vinyasa Flow, Yin, Restorative and Pregnancy
    Yoga and will continue to learn, develop my own practice which I share
    through my teaching.**


    I now realise that, on many occasions in my past, life had been attempting
    to ‘wake me up’ to mySelf, to connect me, in a more intuitive way, to the
    innate ability \[that we all share] to create my life in my vision.
