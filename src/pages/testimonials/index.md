    description: '"I was apprehensive being a novice to yoga. However, from my very
      first class Jae has been extremely professional and patient. Jae has built
      my confidence and enabled me to push boundaries. Every worry and concern
      leaves my mind, as I focus on deeper breaths I never knew existed and
      channeling into my body in new ways. Jae offers a supportive and spiritual
      class which has ignited a real passion for yoga within me, thank you for
      being an amazing teacher and sharing your expertise!"'

    description: “I highly recommend Jae’s classes, she makes everyone feel
      comfortable and there suitable for all abilities. I look forward to my
      yoga class every week and leave feeling really relaxed!”
  - author: Hayley - Private Yoga
    description: “Studying and taking private yoga classes with Jae has had a
      significant impact on my personal yoga practice, as well as my core
      posture. Always encouraged to approach postures in an intelligent,
      conscious manner, I’m far more aware of the subtleties of what we’re
      asking our bodies to do, and of healthy anatomical alignment. Jae is also
      totally approachable and genuinely giving with her great knowledge and
      experience”
  - author: "SL - Focalizing "
    description: ' "Although I was new to this practice and didn’t know what to
      expect, Jae gave me lots of information and made me feel comfortable with
      the whole process. She lead me through with compassion, curiosity and
      acceptance of what came up. She guided me intuitively and helped me
      formulate a foundation upon which to explore, understand and have a
      context for everything that came. I felt held and cared for by Jae and
      felt she had more than enough capacity to guide me through the powerful
      revelations that came up during our sessions. Thank you so much for your
      offering and guidance. It has helped give me a new layer of
      self-understanding and opportunity for healing."'
  - author: Vance - Sound Bath
    description: “Lately, it feels as if I've been trying to keep my head above
      water but treading water takes effort and energy. In those 30 minutes of
      sound bathing there were times where I felt I was either floating
      effortlessly or being gently pulled into the ground as I dipped in and out
      of consciousness. Afterwards, I felt relaxed, peace, freedom, relief,
      reassurance, gratitude and appreciation. It felt like an escape from
      'reality' but it actually brought me back to my reality (or my truth).”
