    description: '"I was apprehensive being a novice to yoga. However, from my very
      first class Jae has been extremely professional and patient. Jae has built
      my confidence and enabled me to push boundaries. Every worry and concern
      leaves my mind, as I focus on deeper breaths I never knew existed and
      channeling into my body in new ways. Jae offers a supportive and spiritual
      class which has ignited a real passion for yoga within me, thank you for
      being an amazing teacher and sharing your expertise!"'

      comfortable and there suitable for all abilities. I look forward to my

  - author: Hayley - Private Yoga
    description: “Studying and taking private yoga classes with Jae has had a
      significant impact on my personal yoga practice, as well as my core
      posture. Always encouraged to approach postures in an intelligent,
      conscious manner, I’m far more aware of the subtleties of what we’re
      asking our bodies to do, and of healthy anatomical alignment. Jae is also
      totally approachable and genuinely giving with her great knowledge and
      experience”
